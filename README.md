# MAVERICKS FRONT END REPOSITORY

## Introduction

This is the platform providing a marketplace for buyers and sellers to meet:

The platform serves as a meeting point for buyers and sellers, where each seller operates a virtual "stall" showcasing
their products. Sellers have full control over their inventory, allowing them to manage stock levels, adjust prices, and
offer discounts. Despite similarities, different sellers can offer identical items.

Shoppers can freely navigate between stalls to find the best deals, selecting items from various sellers and adding them
to their shopping bag. They can modify their bag's contents as they browse. Payments are processed at checkout, and
items can be returned to the stall before purchase. Market owners and administrators have comprehensive access, enabling
them to view all sellers' stock and inspect shoppers' bags.
